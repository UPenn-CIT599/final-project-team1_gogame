Our project, entitled "Go", is a game of Go, the two-player strategy game 
invented in China over 2500 years ago; details on rules and gameplay may be 
found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game). Players are given the option 
to play either against another human player or against a beginner-level computer 
opponent, and they may customize their game in several ways, such as selecting 
the board size, the handicap, and the komi, as well as choosing whether to play 
a timed game. Our program also allows replays of games to be saved as Strategic 
Game Format (sgf) files. Additionally, our program allows the user to view sgf 
replay games (either those created by our program or those created elsewhere), 
as well as to attempt practice problems. All of the above takes place within a 
graphical user interface.
